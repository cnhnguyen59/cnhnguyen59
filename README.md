## Some of My Projects

**TRIPITER** ✈️
<br>
This is my most recent group project for my bootcamp. It is a full-stack appliction that utilizes React, GraphQL, and   Firebase. This app was inspired by pinterest and instagram to allow users a space to document and share the highlights   of their trips.

**BETWEEN THE COVERS** 📖
<br>
This is the second group project for my bootcamp. BTC is a full-stack application that utilized EJS as the template engine, REST API, and MySQL as the database. This app was designed to provide users a platform to create, search for, and join book clubs with a playful dating app-like interface.

**MeteoMelodies** ⛅
<br>
This is the first group project for my bootcamp. This web-app was designed to provide the user with spotify playlists   reccomendations based on the user's current local weather conditions. The app utilized the OpenWeather API to pull       local weather information and passes it to the Spotify API to query through playlists relating to keywords in the       weather description.
